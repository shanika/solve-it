I want to build an app that help to solve problems using an structured approach. First it will ask user's problem. Once the user enter the problem it will ask the user to identify the problem. And then it will ask the user for expected solution. And then it will ask the user to identify the ways to solve that problem. Collected information at each step should be easilly visible for the user when asnwering for next step. This is good enough for the MVP. The next enhancment will be using Open AI latest model to sugest asnswers for steps 2 to 4. So user gets some guidance to progress. User should be able to click to copy given options easilly to their answer input box. Use Shadcn for UI components.  Also use NextJS API routes to securely perfom API calls when you are making API calls to 3rd party apis.

Based on above description create a prd.txt file following the example at @example_prd.txt . Be specifc but give thorow instructions to achive a high quality web app.
